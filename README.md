# 🚀 Pascal University Exercises

Welcome to my **Pascal Learning Repository**! 🎓 This repo contains all my university course exercises in **Pascal**, structured for easy learning and practice. 💡

## 📌 About
This repository is a collection of Pascal exercises from my university coursework. It serves as a **learning hub** 📚 for anyone who wants to:
- Practice Pascal programming 🖥️
- Understand fundamental programming concepts 🔢
- Improve problem-solving skills 🧠

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage
To run these Pascal programs, you need a Pascal compiler. Here are some options:

1. **[Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/)** (Recommended) 🏆
2. **[Turbo Pascal](https://sourceforge.net/projects/turbopascal/)** 🕹️
3. **Online Pascal Compilers** like [JDoodle](https://www.jdoodle.com/pascal-online-compiler) 🌐

### 🔧 Running a Pascal Program
```sh
fpc filename.pas   # Compile the program
./filename         # Run the executable
```
